Uber Eats Clone 
During my learning journey in C# and JavaScript, I took on the challenge of creating an Uber Eats clone.
With my understanding of C# and its integration with the .NET Framework, I developed the backend functionality of the application.
Additionally, I used my skills in JavaScript to handle the frontend components, ensuring a seamless user experience.
